    "This project aims to investigate how visual domain adaptation works between real and stylized (cartoon-like) images. Using an open-source dataset (CIFAR-10) and cartoon-style filters, I will simulate a \"SpongeBob-inspired\" visual style and explore how deep learning models handle classification or domain generalization under these style shifts."

    "## **Dataset Availability**\n",
    "- The project uses CIFAR-10, a public dataset available through PyTorch\n",
    "- It contains 60,000 labeled images across 10 common categories (e.g., cat, car, dog)\n",
    "- No copyright issues exist; all data is free and legally usable\n",
    "- Stylized versions will be created using OpenCV's image filitering tools to simulate cartoon features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Technical Tools**\n",
    "- The project will be implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "- Core libraries include:\n",
    "    - `torch` and `torchvision` for model training and dataset access\n",
    "    - `OpenCV` and `PIL` for cartoon-style filitering\n",
    "    - `matplotlib` for visualization\n",
    "- These tools are open-source and fully compatibile with both local and cloud environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Hardware and Compute Needs**\n",
    "- CIFAR-10 images are small (32Ã—32 pixels), making them very efficient to process.\n",
    "- Training models like ResNet18 with transfer learning is possible on a standard laptop\n",
    "- No high-performance computing is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenge Level**\n",
    "- The project explores domain adaptation, an active research topic in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It includes both a technical component (deep learning model training) and an experimental design (cross-domain evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stylization task introduces variability and tests generalization, adding depth and rigor beyond basic classification."
